Adds a placeholder field to Gravity Forms

This plugin adds a placeholder field into your Gravity Forms input and displays it as a proper HTML5 placeholder attribute without JavaScript (yaay!)

I took code from [this article from wpbeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-placeholder-text-in-gravity-forms/) and optimized it. Applause to them.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `placehold-gravity-forms.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done. Check out your Forms in Gravity Forms.
